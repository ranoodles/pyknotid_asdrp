pyknotid is a Python module for identifying knot types and other
topological quantities. It can take as input space-curves (such as
visualised above) or standard topological notations.

See the :doc:`overview <sources/overview>` for an introduction to
pyknotid's functionality, or find specific topics in the index below.
